# Machine learning algorithms :

## Supervised :

We know the correct output for a dataset and we try to match it.

### Regression :

Being able to predict results in a continuous output.

#### Example :

Price of a house as a function of the size.

### Classification :

Being able to deduce a value in a discreet set from some variables.

#### Example :

Trying to deduce the malicious character of a tumor (Yes or No).

## Unsupervised :

We don't know the correct output for a dataset.

### Clustering :

#### Example :

Grouping a large set of genes by characteristics.

### Non clustering :

Finding a structure in a chaotic data set.

#### Example :

Isolating a voice from background noise (Cocktail party algorithm).

# Symbols :

In a dataset :

m is the number of entries
x are inputs
y are output
h is the hypothesis (The function the algorithm must find)
